# [Flipper Zero](https://flipperzero.one/) 3D models

This repo contains 3D models, drawings, and outlines of Flipper Zero and blank external module PCB.

These files might help you develop your own external module.

All the files are of **F7B9C6** hardware version, which is the **production version** and are safe to depend on.

# Flipper Zero Body

⚠️ 3D models of the body do not include most of the internals for commercial reasons. Outer parts should be enough for your needs.
